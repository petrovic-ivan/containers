## Cluster

A K8s Cluster consists of a Cluster Master and Worker Nodes. 

## Cluster Master

It directs the Worker Nodes. 
Masters make scheduling decisions, respond to events, implement changes, and monitor the Cluster.

## Node

Node is an abstraction for a machine â€” either a physical machine or a virtual machine. 
Node is like a computer server. One or more Pods run on a single Worker Node.

It has following components:
    - kubelet: Brain for Worker Node. Responsible for everything on the Worker Node.
    - kube-proxy: Routes connections to the correct Pods. Also performs load balancing across Pods for a Service. Think traffic cop. 
    - Container Runtime: Downloads images and runs containers. For example, Docker is a Container Runtime. Think Docker.
